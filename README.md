# Cardio_Fitness_Project

In this project, I aimed to identify the customer profiles for each treadmill product offered by CardioGood Fitness. The objective was to analyze customer characteristics and explore potential differences across the various product lines. The dataset used for this analysis contains data on individuals who purchased a treadmill from CardioGood Fitness retail stores over the past three months, and is stored in the CardioGoodFitness.csv file.

The following customer variables were identified for the study:

* product purchased, TM195, TM498, or TM798.
* gender.
* age, in years.
* education, in years.
* relationship status, single or partnered.
* annual household income.
* average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week.
* average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week.
* self-rated fitness on an 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is poor shape and 5 is excellent shape.
